# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
I've implemented several data structures and algorithms with different Big(O) time complexity.
Better solution is uncommented and other solutions which aren't fast or aren't good enough are commented out.
Make sure to contribute or paster your own better solutions with explanation.

Let's build our problem solving approach much more FUN!.
Best of luck for your FAANG Interviews. ðŸ¥³ðŸ¤©
